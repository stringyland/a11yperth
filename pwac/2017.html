        <h2>It's on again!</h2>
        <p>Your chance to learn and share about web accessibility in a casual environment is back for 2017. The Perth Web Accessibility Camp has been running for 4 years for people working in government, online business and education to hear from experts and chat with like-minded people.</p>
        <h3>Keynote</h3>
        <p><strong>Andrew Arch</strong>, Accessibility and Inclusivity Lead at the <a href="https://www.dta.gov.au/">Digital Transformation Agency</a>, will be speaking on <strong>Accessibility Beyond Standards</strong>. In the beginning we had WCAG 1.0, but the web quickly moved ahead of this standard. We then had WCAG 2.0, but it didn't deliver all the accessibility needed. At the end of the day, accessibility is about delivering the right mix of technical requirements alongside usability for people with disability. This combination is necessary to deliver a good experience that enable them to access the information they need and undertake the transactions needed to participate in an increasingly digital world. Andrew will talk about the evolving approach to providing web accessibility, in particular the approach of the Australian Government.</p>
        <h3>The Great Debate</h3>
        <p>The Great Debate is back by popular demand - this year our teams will be arguing the topic <strong>"Getting Sued Is Great For Accessibility"</strong>. David Vosnacos will be our stern moderator and prevent any fights from breaking out.</p>
